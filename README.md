When using GitHub and version control for the first time, do make frequent commits with clear, descriptive messages so you and others can understand the changes made over time. Do use branches to safely test new features or changes without affecting the main code. Do pull regularly to stay updated with the latest version and avoid merge conflicts. On the other hand, don’t commit sensitive information like passwords or API keys, and don’t make large, unrelated changes in a single commit—this makes it harder to track issues. Also, don’t work directly on the main or master branch for development—use feature branches and pull requests to review and manage changes effectively.
