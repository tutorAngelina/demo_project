In this file, we will learn about Python dictionaries. Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

Example structure:

california_slang = {
    "Yeah no" : "No",
    "No yeah" : "Yes",
    "Yeah no, for sure" : "Yes"
}

print(california_slang["No yeah"]) <- this will print "Yes"
'''
spanish_numbers = {
    1: "uno",
    2: "dos",
    3: "tres",
    4: "cuatro",
    5: "cinco"    
}
